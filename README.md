# My Journey to a Better Future

This repository documents my commitment to rebuilding my life through discipline, self-education, and technology.

After returning home from prison on December 15, 2024, my technology journey started.

I’m learning Linux, Networking, Python, and Django, and using those skills to build real projects that showcase growth and capability.

Everything in this repository reflects progress, perseverance, and purpose.

One step at a time, I’m working toward a better generational outcome for my family.

## Notes

This is a live repo. As I learn, break things, and build, I’ll update the tools and configurations I use. My journey is just starting and I'm documenting it all here.
