## My Journey to a better future for grandchildren 

This lab is part of my personal transformation.

After leaving prison on 15 Dec 2024, I committed to rebuilding my life through technology. I'm now pursuing a career in **Network Administration with a cybersecurity focus**. Everything in this repository documents real skills I’m building — not just to land a job, but to become someone who protects systems and secures networks.

This isn't just a project — it's part of my new path forward.
