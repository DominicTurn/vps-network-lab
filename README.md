# My Journey to a Better Future — For Me and My Grandchildren

This project is part of my commitment to building a new life through technology.

After returning home from prison on December 15, 2024, I chose to create opportunity through discipline, self-education, and consistency.

My goal is to become a skilled **Network Administrator** with a **cybersecurity toolkit** — capable of protecting systems and hardening networks. Everything in this repository reflects progress, learning, and purpose.

One step at a time, I’m working toward a better generational outcome for my family.

## VPS Network Security Lab

This lab serves as my hands-on training ground for learning:

- Linux system administration
- Network configuration and monitoring
- System security and hardening
- Basic cybersecurity tooling and detection

---

## Server Environment

- **Provider:** RackNerd VPS
- **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Specs:**  
  - 2 vCPU Cores  
  - 2.5 GB RAM  
  - 40 GB SSD Storage  
  - 1Gbps Public Network Port  
  - 1 Dedicated IPv4  
  - Full Root Admin Access  

---

## Completed Security Setup

- [x] SSH key authentication configured
- [x] Root login disabled
- [x] New non-root user with sudo privileges
- [ ] Fail2Ban installation and config (in progress)
- [ ] UFW firewall configured with only necessary ports open
- [ ] Security updates automated
- [ ] Audit tools installed (e.g. rkhunter, chkrootkit, auditd)

---

## Learning Goals

- Strengthen command line fluency (bash, ssh, vim/nano)
- Practice real server hardening techniques
- Set up and monitor basic networking tools
- Build a foundational cybersecurity skill set from scratch

---

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: VPS Security Basics
- [x] Secure SSH with keys
- [x] Remove root access
- [ ] Configure UFW
- [ ] Install Fail2Ban
- [ ] Enable automatic security updates

### Phase 2: Networking Tools & Monitoring
- [ ] Set up Nginx or Apache
- [ ] Install `netstat`, `iftop`, `tcpdump`, `nmap`
- [ ] Set up log monitoring and rotation

### Phase 3: Cybersecurity Practice
- [ ] Deploy basic honeypot (SSHtrap or Cowrie)
- [ ] Simulate brute-force attacks (safe test)
- [ ] Analyze logs and detect anomalies

---

## Long-Term Goal

To transition into a **Network Administrator** role by the beginning of 2026, with the skills to **secure and maintain systems** in real-world environments. This lab is where the training happens.

## Notes

This is a live repo. As I learn, break things, and build, I’ll update the tools and configurations I use. My journey is just getting started — and I'm documenting it all here.
